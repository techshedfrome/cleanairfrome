# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
#   push:
#     branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ deploy ]
    types: [closed]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
#     # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
#     - uses: actions/checkout@v2
#       with:         
#         path: 'work'


    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
#     - name: Run a one-line script
#       run: echo Hello, world!
