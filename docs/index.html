              <h3>Empowering the community with information</h3>
              <p>
                Adverse health effects caused by air pollution are increasingly being recognised and debated at national and international level.  In response to this, Tech Shed Frome in partnership with the Town Council has developing a system around low-cost air quality sensors that are placed in key sites around Frome.  Our aim is to empower the community with information on how vehicle traffic and other sources of pollutants can impact air quality over time.

              <h3>What do you mean by air quaility?</h3>
              <p>
                We measure air quality by the capturing level of particulate matter.  This is produced principally by vehicle exhaust emissions, dust from vehicle brake linings and burning wood. The particulate matter is measured in 2/.5 and 10.0 Micron sizes, and in quantities of parts per million in the air, we breathe. The particulate count is a good measure for understanding the impact of the air quality on a person’s health.  See further reading.  We also capture the temperature and humidity.

              <h3>Health effects of poor air quality</h3>
              <p>
                Air pollution can affect everyone’s health. Poor air quality is the largest environmental risk to public health in the UK, as long-term exposure to air pollution can cause chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer, leading to reduced life expectancy.  It’s even more of a worry for people living with a lung condition, older people and children as their lungs are more vulnerable.
